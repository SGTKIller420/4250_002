  - Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a creation of a buisness model in order for products and services to evolve into a reliable stream of improvements.

Software Engineering Lifecycle Phases, Definitions & Descriptions:

1) Requirements: Gathering needs and minimum functions to conceptualize the scope of the project.  (Josh Rimell)
  - Consulting and gathering information from the Project Lead and customers
  - Meeting needs
  - Constraints and limitations
  - Expertise involved/ specific descriptions
2) Design: The process of creating a plan or model in order to meet listed requirements.   (Josh Rimell)
  - How a system will be structured and function/ creating a model/ overall architecture
  - Detailed technical specifications/ inputs from customers and requirements gathering
  - Decision making
  - Team layout & organization
3) Implementation: The process of engineering the product based on requirements and design.   (Josh Rimell)
  - Proper integration
  - Updates as needed
  - Solidifies theoretical concepts
  - Documentation
  - Actual coding
  - Connecting subsystems/ building features and extentions
  - Type of software using in-house or not
  - Hardware/software specifications and limitations
4) Testing: Rigorous process of using input or data in order to see if product or service meets requirements (Jerry)
  - Systematically evaluate
  - Make sure it works
  - Secure for release
  - Identifying and fixing defects and issues
  - Testing improper inputs
  - Integration testing, user acceptance testing, performance testing, security testing
  - Documentation of results
  - Meets requirements
5) Release: The process after testing where the product or service is sold or in its "go live" phase.   (Jerry)
  - Installation and deployment
  - User feedback
  - Documentation
  - Support for current system
  - Potential downtime
  - Plan for release
  - Availability and distribution to users/customers
  - Support on launch
6) Support/Maintenance: Includes ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates. (Josh Rimell)
  - Allocates resources
  - Fixing defects
  - Bug fixes
  - Security updates
  - Prevent issues
  - Keeping the system functional/ ongoing support
  - Keeping customer and team informed on updates
7) Upgrades/Updates: Changes of any size to a system. It includes new features or modifications. (Josh Rimell)
  - Covers changes of any size that results in new features
  - More advanced security
  - Updates are regular
  - Upgrades can involve migration to new technology
