Problem #2: String ASCII

Design:
Array of size 256 to represent ASCII characters (extended)
Prompt User (string or file), use decision structure to determine which "branch" the code needs to take.

String Branch
  - Use a loop to move through each char in the string and use the ASCII representation to iterate (count) each character
    that is inside our array of ASCII numbers.
  - Return the count of each char and display the top 3 most found characters, also return any chars with a count of 0.
  - Then take the string and use a for loop starting from the end of the string and using i-- to print the string in reverse order.
  - Handle exceptions; blank string, etc.

File Branch
