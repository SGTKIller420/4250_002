Requirements Analysis

Mandatory

•	Must prompt user for two positive integers (M NF)
•	Must inform user that inputs can only be positive integers (M F)
•	Must inform user that inputs must be less than or equal to 10,000 (M F)
•	Must add the two positive integers from user input together to get sum (M NF)
•	Must separate least significant digit from the sum (M NF)
•	Must add separated least significant digit to remaining integer (M NF)
•	Must use recursion to repeat the process until a single digit is achieved (M NF)
•	Must show resulting single digit to user (M NF)
•	User must be able to continue or exit (M F)
•	Invalid inputs must display an error message (M NF)
•	If the user uses an invalid input, the program prompts for new valid inputs (M NF)

Optional

•	User can use doubles as inputs (O F)
•	User can use negative integers or doubles as inputs (O F)
•	Can display the result of the sum for the user (O F)

Design 

Risk: Inputs and sum of inputs can result in Overflow exception.
Solution: Limit input range to a maximum of 10,000.

Risk: Inputs are < 1.
Solution: Display an error message and re-prompt user for valid inputs.
