Requirements Assignment â€“ Absent Monday
- Try to write the requirements for a program that bounces a ball off the sides of the screen
and any obstacles larger than 3 pixels the user draws with the mouse
- The program must have set bounds for all four sides of the screen
- The program needs to detect the mouse, and be able to draw pixels
- The pixels must have collision around them, the same collision that the
boundaries for the screen has that allows it to bounce the ball
- The program needs to have a ball that has velocity when it begins, as well as
redirection when it collides with obstacles or the screen boundaries
- Do the obstacles eventually disappear? If so the program needs an internal timer
for each obstacle that will remove it once the time goes away
- What happens for obstacles lesser than 3 pixels? The program should immediately
delete them, or make them disappear. (same internal clock as above but set to 0)
- What is the velocity of the ball initially? The program must have a constant
velocity for the ball, or one that updates based on collision.


- Try to write the requirements for simple arcade style driving game where the player has
to navigate around obstacles to keep from crashing.
- The program needs to have a race track, with obstacles that have collision when
the driver collides with them
- The program needs to have a pre generated track, or a procedurally
generated, including the track as well as obstacles
- The program needs to have a set speed for the racer, as well as velocity for turning
left and right
- The program needs to have an end scene, where the player eventually does hit an
obstacle
- (Optional) The program needs to have a high score system that displays when the
game ends
- The high score system will increase as long as the game is running
