My name is Sophia and I am concentrating in computer science. I have worked on BSPs (web apps through SAP) using HTML and JavaScript for work. I have also created automatic unit tests using Jest and Node. I have experience with Java and C#. I have some experience with SQL (I write inline SQL in ABAP often). I am good at maintaining organization and communication within groups. I have been through most of the core computing classes (data structures, algorithms, database fundamentals, etc.) and I am currently taking web development as an elective.
