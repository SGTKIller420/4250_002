I am a junior UX designer working on a BFA in Graphic Design with a Computing minor.
I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and C#. I also have some knowledge on database managemnet and SQL.
In past jobs, I have managed teams of people and have some experience in project management.
My skills are best utilized in design, management, and leadership; however, I am a quick learner, and enjoy problem solving.
I would be happy to join a team in which my design background can be best utilized, but due to my adaptive nature, I am capable of filling whatever role is necessary.
