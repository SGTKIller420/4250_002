Hello, my name is David Edwards and I am a Computing major with a concentration in Computer Science.

My languages are C#, Java, some Python and some SQL.

I am very team orienated and enjoy being in a good group where we all get along.
I tend not to take the leader role just because that has never been me, but I am very
good team player which steams from me playing sports all my life.

I have taking all the mandatory classes that are meant to be completed by this time.
