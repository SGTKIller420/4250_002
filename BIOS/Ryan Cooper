Hello, my name is Ryan Cooper

I am a Senior going through the CS concentration so I have a wide spread of programming languages (C, C#, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, etc.)                                                                                                   

I've been in plenty of group projects before and have always found success with my teammates. 
I prioritize communication and organization so that we can have a plan and work together effectively.

When it comes to SE1 I feel as though I have a good grasp on the content we've gone over so far and am confident moving forward.

As far as my schedule goes I am very flexible so getting together in person wouldn't be an issue and I definitely value in-person meetings. 

Overall, I feel like I would be a good teammate for programming purposes and reinforcing the Software Engineering Lifecycle so that 
  we can appropriately meet (and hopefully exceed) Kinser's expectations for our final project.
