Hello, I am Trent Williams. I am a Senior in Computing with a concentration in I.T.

I have used C#, HTML/CSS, Java, JSON, SQL, and some C++ and Python. 
I have experience with Windows, Unix, and Mac. 

I have worked on several team projects throughout my time at ETSU. Those including: 
~ developing a website for a customer in CSCI 1210
~ creating an RPG game in CSCI 1260
~ using SAP in a team environment in CSCI 3700

Personal Projects:
~ IP Address lookup page in CSCI 1720

Work:
  I am currently working at a local healthcare provider in IT. I mainly do general HelpDesk duties, 
however, I have worked on several projects. I migrated 200+ users from Windows 7 - 10, helped manage 
converting from analog phones to VoIP, and I have also helped manage/change our current door software.
Thus resulting in project management experience.
