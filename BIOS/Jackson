Hello, my name is Jackson, I sit at the cool table.
I like long walks in the park and getting caught in the rain.

I have some amount of proficiency in C#, C, Java, SQL. I have a little bit of skill with html, but not much else when it comes to a web developement enviroment.
I really don't know what else to put here, so please just like, comment, and subscribed I guess. And please don't forget to hit that bell so you get notfied of future videos.
